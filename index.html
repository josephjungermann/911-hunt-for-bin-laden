            A small, green passport belonging to an anonymous Al-Qaeda member sat next to a weathered page, burnt at its edges, filled with stamps from the Pakistan government.
            <p>Just several inches away was a wall fragment made of blue tile from Osama bin Laden’s terrorist training camp.</p>
            <p>Each artifact tells a history of the United States decade-long hunt to shut down bin Laden and his terrorist organization even long before he plotted his horrific Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center that killed nearly 3,000
              people.</p>
            <p>Now, these once-classified documents, intel and artifacts will be revealed at the 9/11 Memorial Museum on Nov. 15 to give viewers an in-depth look at how the men, women, agencies, military and government from all parts of the country
              devoted themselves to tracking down and killing bin Laden.</p>
            <p>“Our mission calls for examination of the ongoing repercussions of the 9/11 attacks, and there is no other institution that can tell this story with quite the same impact afforded by the powerful symbolism of this site,” said 9/11
              Memorial Museum President and CEO Alice Greenwald.</p>
            <p>The new exhibit titled "Revealed: The Hunt for Bin Laden" is presented as more than just a history lesson and timeline of bin Laden’s terror and inevitable death. Scenes and photos detailing the Navy SEALs’ raid of bin Laden’s compound
              stronghold in Abbottabad, Pakistan, will be presented in an interactive format so visitors can understand the impact of the Al-Qaeda leader’s fall.</p>
            <p>“The message that we try to carry throughout the whole story is, first and foremost, the extraordinary commitment of the people who were on this 10-year-hunt after 9/11, the effort it took and the sacrifices we made,” said Clifford
              Chanin, the Executive Vice President and Deputy Director of 9/11 Museum’s Programs.</p>
            <p>The exhibit also offers an opportunity for the men and women involved in tracking bin Laden to reflect on the material presented.</p>
            <p>“There’s a sense of pride of what America and all the individuals that helped in this hunt came together,” said John Paluska, a military veteran of 15 years. “It’s also a reminder of the war we still face; We still have military
              members who are overseas sacrificing their lives, and this educates the general public on the challenges we continue to face.”</p>
            <p>Mary Galligan, a former Cyber and Special Operations Agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had a chance to speak about the exhibit and reflect on the bittersweet emotions she had after the United States succeeded in killing
              bin Laden.</p>
            <p>“There was incredible pride and at the same time, there was questioning of should we be joyful about this? Should we be sad that it took 10 years or disappointed that it took 10 years? Or are we still doing everything that we possibly
              can?"</p>
            <p>Despite all the emotions that the exhibit will provoke when it opens to the public, perhaps closure for victims’ families will be the biggest takeaway.</p>
            <p>Maureen and Alexander Santora, the parents of Engine 54 firefighter Christopher Santora, who lost his life at age 23 during the 9/11 attacks, summed up what the museum’s exhibit meant to them.</p>
            <p>“To me, this is a completion of this story. This is the completion of a tale of history,” said Santora standing hand-in-hand with her husband. “This is the end of a chapter. It tells a story, and we’re very delighted it ended this
              way,” he added.</p>
            <p>“This brings it all together.”</p>
